# Online Shopping Website

This repository contains the source code for an online shopping website, built for the purpose of web development education. The website is built using a combination of JavaScript, CSS and HTML as a frontend, NodeJS for backend and MongoDB as a database. I have used the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern to enhance the maintainability and scalability of the code.

## Features
The website is divided into two types of authorization: administrator and customer.

## Administrator 
The administrator has access to a special route for editing or adding items to the list of items for sale. The administrator can perform the following tasks:

Add new items to the list of items for sale.
Edit existing items details for sale.
Delete items from the list of items for sale.
Update purchased order status.

## Customer
The customer can only browse and purchase items from the list of items for sale. The customer can perform the following tasks:

Browse the list of items for sale.
Add items to the shopping cart.
Checkout and purchase items in the shopping cart.
